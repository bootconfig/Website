Project:
  Website is a repository that I'm practicing with to enhance my web development skills.

Goal:
  Currently, I hope to design a webpage that features tutorials on the open source upbge game engine.
  Upbge is an emerging feature rich game engine with a real time renderer eevee.
  A link to the home page on the upbge website can be found here: https://upbge.org/#/
